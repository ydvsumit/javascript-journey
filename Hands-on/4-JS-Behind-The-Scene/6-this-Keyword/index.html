      <h1>"this" Keyword</h1>
      <li>
        The "this" keyword is a special reference that represents the context in
        which a function is executed.
      </li>
      <li>
        It tells you who is calling the function or which object function
        belongs to.
      </li>
      <h2># In Short & Simple:</h2>
      <li>
        The this keyword in JavaScript is a special identifier whose value
        depends on how and where a function is called.
      </li>
      <li>
        It does not behave like variables â€” instead, it is dynamically set at
        runtime.
      </li>
      <li>
        It's value depends on how the function is invoked, not where it's
        written.
      </li>
      <h2>"this" keyword behavior for Regular Function:</h2>
      <p>
        "this" keyword is not static that means it's "dynamic binding" -- this
        change based on how the function is called.
      </p>
      <h2>"this" keyword behavior for Arrow Function:</h2>
      <li>It does not change "this" behavior based on how you call them.</li>
      <li>
        This is a "lexical" (inherited from surrounding scope, fixed at
        creation).
      </li>
