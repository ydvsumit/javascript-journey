      <h1>Memory Mangement : Garbage Collection & Mark and Sweep Algorithm</h1>
      <h2># CALL STACK:</h2>
      <li>
        Variable Environment is simply deleted when execution context pops off
        stack.
      </li>
      <li>
        The global variable never deleted from gloabal execution context
        <b>(GEC never disappears).</b>
      </li>
      <h2># HEAP:</h2>
      <li>Memory management is more complex.</li>
      <li>
        In order to delete old unused objects from the heap and free up memory,
        JS Engine employ a process called <b>"Garbage Collection".</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        Garbage Collection is a <b>"central memory management tool"</b> in a JS
        Engine.
      </li>
      <h2>
        # MARK AND SWEEP ALGORITHM: (Underneath HEAP in Garbage Collection)
      </h2>
      <li>
        There are different ways to implement garbage collection but the most
        common strategy Garbage Collection (GC) uses is called
        <b>Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm.</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        All modern engines use an algorithm that called <b>Mark and Sweep.</b>
      </li>
      <p><b>STEPS:</b></p>
      <h2>1. MARK:</h2>
      <li>
        Mark all objects that are <b>"reachable"</b> from a <b>"root"</b> as
        alive.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Root</b> are basically starting point to search for alive objects.
      </li>
      <h2>2. SWEEP:</h2>
      <li>
        Delete un-marked <b>"unreachable"</b> objects and reclaim memory for
        future allocations.
      </li>
      <p>
        <b># Global Execution context stay forever and never disappears.</b>
      </p>
      <h2>Memory Leak:</h2>
      <li>
        When objects that are no longer are
        <b>"incorrectly still reachable"</b>, and therefore
        <b>"not being garbage collected"</b> from one of the roots.
      </li>
      <li>As a result, the object is marked as alive.</li>
