      <h1>EXECUTION CONTEXT & THE CALL STACK</h1>
      <h2>Global Context</h2>
      <li>
        Creation of "Global Execution Context" for "Top-Level-Code" that is
        "Default Context" also.
      </li>
      <li>All the context together makes the call stack.</li>
      <li>
        A top level code is basically code that is not inside any function so
        only the code that is outside of functions will be executed.
      </li>
      <li>Function should be executed when they are called.</li>
      <h1>EXECUTION CONTEXT</h1>
      <li>Execution Context is an abstract concept.</li>
      <li>Environment in which a piece of javascript is executed.</li>
      <li>
        Stores all the necessary information for some code to be executed.
      </li>
      <h2>IMPORTANT NOTE TO BE KNOW:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Global Execution Context is created once and stays until the program
          ends.
        </li>
        <li>
          Exactly one global execution context: Default context, created for
          code that is not inside any function. (top level code)
        </li>
        <li>
          One execution context "per function": For each function call, a new
          execution context is created.
        </li>
        <li>
          Every time you call a function, a new Execution Context is pushed onto
          the Call Stack.
        </li>
        <li>When the function finishes, its context is popped.</li>
      </ol>
      <h1>CALL STACK</h1>
      <p>
        "Place" where execution contexts get stacked on top of each other, to
        keep track of where we are in the execution.
