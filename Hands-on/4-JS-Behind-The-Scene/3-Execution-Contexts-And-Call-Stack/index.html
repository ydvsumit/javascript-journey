      <h1>EXECUTION CONTEXT & THE CALL STACK</h1>
      <h2>Global Context</h2>
      <li>
        Creation of "Global Execution Context" for "Top-Level-Code" that is
        "Default Context" also.
      </li>
      <li>All the context together makes the call stack.</li>
      <li>
        A top level code is basically code that is not inside any function so
        only the code that is outside of functions will be executed.
      </li>
      <li>Function should be executed when they are called.</li>
      <h1>EXECUTION CONTEXT</h1>
      <li>
        Definition: The execution context (EC) is the environment where
        javascript code is evaluated and executed. It defines what variables,
        functions and objects are accessible at a given time during code
        execution.
      </li>
      <li>Execution Context is an abstract concept.</li>
      <li>Environment in which a piece of javascript is executed.</li>
      <h2>Types of Exection Context:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Global Execution Context (GEC) / Global Context / Default Context
        </li>
        <li>Function Execution Context</li>
        <li>Eval Execution Context (rarely used)</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>IMPORTANT NOTE TO BE KNOW:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Global Execution Context is created once and stays until the program
          ends.
        </li>
        <li>
          Exactly one global execution context: Default context, created for
          code that is not inside any function. (top level code)
        </li>
        <li>
          One execution context "per function": For each function call, a new
          execution context is created.
        </li>
        <li>
          Every time you call a function, a new Execution Context is pushed onto
          the Call Stack.
        </li>
        <li>When the function finishes, its context is popped.</li>
      </ol>
      <h1>CALL STACK</h1>
      <p>
        "Place" where execution contexts get stacked on top of each other, to
        keep track of where we are in the execution.
      </p>
      <h2>Execution Context Stack:</h2>
      <li>JavaScript manages execution contexts using a Call Stack.</li>
      <li>Following -> <b>LIFO (Last In, First Out)</b></li>
      <h2>Steps that execution context stack follows:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>When the script starts -> GEC is pushed to stack.</li>
        <li>When a function is called -> FEC is created and pushes on top.</li>
        <li>When the function finishes -> FEC is popped from stack.</li>
        <li>Finally, GEC is popped out when the program ends.</li>
      </ol>
