      <h1>SCOPE CONCEPTS</h1>
      <h2># Scoping:</h2>
      <li>How our program's variables are organized and accessed.</li>
      <li>
        Where do variables live? or where can we access a certain variable and
        where not?
      </li>
      <h2># Lexical Scoping:</h2>
      <li>
        Scoping is controlled by placement of functions and blocks in the code.
      </li>
      <li>
        Or where we can access variables are based on exactly where in the code
        functions and blocks are written.
      </li>
      <li>
        Note: Lexical like hierarchy or a sequence of order of child to parent.
      </li>
      <h2># Scope Chain:</h2>
      <li>
        It is the process in which, JavaScript engine searches for the value of
        the variables in the scope of the functions. However, the search is in a
        lexical manner. First of all the engine looks out in the current scope
        of the current function. If not found, it finds it in the parent
        function.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scope chain is directly proportional to lexical or context environment.
        (created when a function is created)
      </li>
      <li>
        In Short: Order in which variables and function are written in the code.
        And also has nothing to do with order in which function were called.
      </li>
      <h2># Variable Environment:</h2>
      <li>
        The variable environment is a component of an execution context that
        stores variables, function declarations and arguments within a
        particular scope.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each time a JavaScript function or global script is executed, an
        execution context is created and a variable environment is a part of
        that context.
      </li>
      <h2># Scope:</h2>
      <li>
        Scope is the place in our code where variables and functions are
        declared.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scope defines the encapsulated area of our code in which local and
        global variables are accessible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Local variables are scoped inside of encapsulation and can not be
        accessed outside of it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whereas, global variables are accessed in any scope of encapsulation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scope means where you can access a specific variable of function in your
        code.
      </li>
      <h2># Scope has Three Types:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Global Scope</li>
        <li>Function Scope</li>
        <li>Block Scope (ES6)</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>1. Global Scope:</h2>
      <li>Outside of any function or block</li>
      <li>Variables declared in global scope are accessible everywhere.</li>
      <h2>2. Function Scope:</h2>
      <li>Variables are accessible only inside function, NOT outside.</li>
      <li>Also called "Local Scope".</li>
      <li>If we are trying to access, throw an reference error.</li>
      <h2>3. Block Scope (ES6):</h2>
      <li>Variables are accessible only inside block (block scoped).</li>
      <li>For Example: if-else, for loop, etc.</li>
      <li>However, this only applies to "let" & "const" variables.</li>
      <li>Functions are also block scoped (only in strict mode).</li>
