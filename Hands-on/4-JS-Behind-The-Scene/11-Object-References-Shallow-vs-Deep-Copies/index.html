      <h1>Object Reference : Shallow vs Deep Copies</h1>
      <h2># Shallow Copy (Using Spread Operator: Not a Proper Solution)</h2>
      <p>
        Using spread operator, we can copy original object into a new variable
        but if original object has nested object, in that scenario, it copy only
        first level object propery but not nested object and for nested object
        Reference address is same in memory. This is called "Shallow Copy".
      </p>
      <h2># structuredClone() => (Deep Copy/Clone)</h2>
      <li>
        So, we have a function for deep copy or deep clone of an any object that
        is called "StructuredClone()".
      </li>
      <p>Note:</p>
      <li>
        We can see below, it does deep copy i.e. nested object copy into new
        variable with new address and it does not change any value in original
        object.
      </li>
      <li>
        We can perform any changes in new one without impacting original object.
      </li>
      <li>
        Few years ago, it's bit harder because back then we had to use an
        extenal library like "lodash", if we want to do deep clones.
