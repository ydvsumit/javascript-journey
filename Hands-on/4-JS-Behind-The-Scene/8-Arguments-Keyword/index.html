      <li>
        It looks like an array (but not a real array), but it's actually an
        array like object.
      </li>
      <li>
        It has "indexed value" and a "length" property, but it doesn't have
        array methods like .map or .forEach() etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        It contains all the values that were passed to the function when it was
        invoked.
