      <h1>Hoisting and The Temperal Dead Zone</h1>
      <h2># Hoisting:</h2>
      <p>
        Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior in which a function or variables
        accessible/usable in the code before they are actually declared.
      </p>
      <h2># Important Note:</h2>
      <li>
        var keyword is hoisted with a default initialization of undefined.
        <ul class="ul-disc">
          <li>
            So accessing them before the line they were declared returns
            undefined.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        let and const declarations are also Hoisted without a default
        initialization in Temporal Dead Zone for the time being.
        <ul class="ul-disc">
          <li>
            So accessing them before the line they were declared throws
            ReferenceError: Cannot access 'variable' before initialization.
          </li>
          <li>
            In case of let and const are allocated memory & different memory
            location named script or (if in Block) than global.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <h2># How it works behind the scene?</h2>
      <p>
        Before execution, code is scanned for variable declarations, and for
        each variable, a new property is created in the "variable environment
        object".
      </p>
      <h2># Temporal Dead Zone:</h2>
      <li>
        There's a name for the period during execution where let/const variables
        are hoisted but not accessible: it's called the Temporal Dead Zone.
      </li>
      <p>OR</p>
      <li>
        It is the time since when this let and const variables are hoisted and
        till it is initialized some value, that time between that is known as
        Temporal Dead Zone.
      </li>
