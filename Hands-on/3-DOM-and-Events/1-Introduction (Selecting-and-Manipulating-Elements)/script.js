/**
 * DOM :
 *      - Document Object Model
 *      - Structured Representation of HTML document Representation
 *      - DOM allows javascript to access HTML elements and styles to manipulate them.
 * Example :
 *          - we will be able to change text, HTML attributes and also change css styles from our JavaScript.
 * - we can say, DOM is basically a connection point b/w HTML Document and Javascript code.
 *
 * Note :-
 *        # DOM is automatically created by the browser as soon as the HTML page loads.
 *        # And it's stored in a tree structure (generated by browser on HTML Load).
 *
 * Key Features :
 *  1. Selecting & Manipulating Elements
 *  2. Handling click events
 *  3. Manipulating CSS
 *  4. Working with class
 *
 * Document :
 *          - Document is a special object that we have access to in javascript and this object serves as an entry point into the DOM.
 *          - Example: document.querySelector()
 *
 * Important Note :
 *          - use # for select id from HTML to manipulate DOM.
 *          - use . for select class from HTML to manipulate DOM.
 *
 *  # DOM and all the methods and properties that we can use to manipulate the DOM, such as document or query selector and lots of another stuff are actually "not a part of javascript".
 *    - However, Javascript is actually just a dialect of ECMAScript specification.
 *
 * Question: If the DOM is not a part of javascript language then how does this all work?
 * Answer: DOM and DOM methods are actually part of something called the WebAPI's.
 *
 * Web APIs : (Application Programming Interface)
 *          - Web APIs are like libraries that browsers implement and that we can access from our javascript code or interact with javascript code.
 *          - Web APIs are basically libraries that are also written in javascript and that are automatically available for us to use.

// Select Class Element
