      <h1>DOM and Manipulation</h1>
      <h2>DOM :</h2>
      <li>Document Object Model</li>
      <li>Structured Representation of HTML document Representation</li>
      <li>
        DOM allows javascript to access HTML elements and styles to manipulate
        them.
      </li>
      <h2>Example :</h2>
      <li>
        we will be able to change text, HTML attributes and also change css
        styles from our JavaScript.
      </li>
      <p class="exampleNote">
        we can say, DOM is basically a connection point b/w HTML Document and
        Javascript code.
      </p>
      <h2>Key Features :</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Selecting & Manipulating Elements</li>
        <li>Handling click events</li>
        <li>Manipulating CSS</li>
        <li>Working with class</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Note :</h2>
      <li>
        DOM is automatically created by the browser as soon as the HTML page
        loads.
      </li>
      <li>
        And it's stored in a tree structure (generated by browser on HTML Load).
      </li>
      <h1>Document</h1>
      <p>
        Document is a special object that we have access to in javascript and
        this object serves as an entry point into the DOM.
      </p>
      <p>Example : document.querySelector() etc.</p>
      <h2>Important Note :</h2>
      <li>use # for select id from HTML to manipulate DOM.</li>
      <li>use . for select class from HTML to manipulate DOM.</li>
      <h2>
        DOM and all the methods and properties that we can use to manipulate the
        DOM, such as document or query selector and lots of another stuff are
        actually "not a part of javascript".
      </h2>
      <p>
        However, Javascript is actually just a dialect of ECMAScript
        specification.
      </p>
      <h2>
        # Question: If the DOM is not a part of javascript language then how
        does this all work?
      </h2>
      <h2>
        # Answer: DOM and DOM methods are actually part of something called the
        WebAPI's.
      </h2>
      <h1>Web APIs (Application Programming Interface)</h1>
      <p>
        <li>
          Web APIs are like libraries that browsers implement and that we can
          access from our javascript code or interact with javascript code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Web APIs are basically libraries that are also written in javascript
          and that are automatically available for us to use.
        </li>
