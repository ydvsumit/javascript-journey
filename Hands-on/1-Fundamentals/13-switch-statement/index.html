      <h1>The Switch Statement</h1>
      <p>
        A switch is another way to make decisions in code. It is often used when
        you want to compare one value against multiple possible matches instead
        of writing many if...else if...else statements.
      </p>
      <h2>=> break :</h2>
      <li>
        The break statement stops the execution of the switch block once a
        matching case is found.
      </li>
      <li>
        Without break, the program will continue to run the next cases
        (fallthrough) even if they donâ€™t match.
      </li>
      <li>
        Because there are no breaks, execution continues (this is called
        fallthrough).
      </li>
